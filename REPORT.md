In this individual project, I developed a new dynamic website for the University of the Third Age Townsville (U3A).   
My main goals were to create a new, user-friendly website catered towards senior citizens of Townsville. Instead of   
creating a theme from scratch, I used an existing theme and created a child theme for it. Although I had already worked   
with a real client in a previous project before, this gave me another opportunity to gain more experience and correct my   
past errors.

A significant part of this project was to use a development and deployment workflow. This was something I had struggled  
with in the past. This time I focused on relearning different workflow methodologies and how to use them effectively in   
a project. With a better understanding of workflows, I made a start on the project.

I compared the different hosting options I was given and decided to use Digital Ocean. Digital Ocean had the shallowest  
learning curve, and I had minimal issues with it. Similar to my previous work, this was the most challenging step. I ran  
into multiple compatibility issues with Windows and Ubuntu, which took hours of troubleshooting. I also struggled to   
create a .yml file that ran without errors. I overcame this by taking a break from the project and looking at Docker guides and   
documentation to better understand how Docker and the .yml file work. This was a good way to improve my troubleshooting   
skills. I used GitHub for version control in both Local and Production environments. While doing this, I gained more   
experience with using the command line for Git instead of an IDE.

While I was experienced in WordPress site creation, this project gave me another opportunity to improve my PHP and CSS   
skills. I encountered many roadblocks during this project, and it forced me to continue learning and practicing. I used   
Trello to manage this project. By using Trello, I was able to break down larger steps into smaller tasks, which made the   
work more manageable and less overwhelming. I was able to set deadlines for tasks on Trello, which helped to improve my   
time management.

This individual project has been a great learning experience for me. While it was demanding at times, it allowed me to   
enhance my technical and project management skills. I'm proud of the outcome I have achieved and look forward to using   
my newfound experience and skills in future opportunities.
