In this individual project, I developed a new dynamic website for the University of the Third Age Townsville(u3a). My main  
goals were to create a new user-friendly website catered towards senior citizens of townsville. Instead of creating a theme   
from scratch, I used and existing theme and created a child theme for it. Although I had already worked with a real client in a 
previous project before, this gave me another opportunity to gain more experience and correct my past errors.  

A significant part of this project was to a use development and deployment workflow. This was something I had struggled with  
in the past. This time I focused on relearning different workflow methodologies and how to use them effectively in a project.  
With a better understanding of workflows I made a start on the project.

I compared the different hosting options I was given and decided to use Digital Ocean. Digital ocean had the shallowest  
learning curve, and I had minimal issues with it. Similar to my previous work, this was the most challenging step.  
I ran into multiple compatibility issues with windows and ubuntu which took hours of troubleshooting. I also struggled to  
create a .yml file that ran without errors. I overcame this by taking a break from the project and looking at docker  
guides and documentation to better understand how docker and the .yml file works. This was a good way to improve my  
troubleshooting skills. I used GitHub for version control in both Local and Production environments. While doing this,  
I gained more experience with using the commandline for git instead of an IDE.

While I was experience in WordPress site creation, This project gave me another opportunity to improve my PHP and CSS skills.  
I encountered many roadblocks during this project, and it forced me to continue learning and practicing. I used trello manage  
this project. By using trello I was able to break down larger steps in to smaller tasks which made the work more manageable  
and less overwhelming. I was able to set deadlines for tasks on trello which helped to improve my time management. 

This individual project has been a great learning experience for me. While it was demanding at times, it allowed me to enhance  
my technical and project management skills. I'm proud of the outcome I have achieved and look forward to using my newfound  
experience nad skill in future opportunities.
